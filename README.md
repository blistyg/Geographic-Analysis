# Geographic-Analysis
Replication repo for short report on geographic labor analysis of US counties 

To recreate output in `geo_analysis.pdf`:
  1) Clone repo
  2) Ensure data in the `\Data` file is downloaded to local machine
  3) Run the `geo_analysis.Rmd` file
  4) Alternatively, use `source(script.R)` to run it from console.

Potential next steps:
  1) Replace BEA data with Burning Glass data
  2) Find alternative diversity indicies besides what NEA uses.
  3) Compute ranks for different region levels beyond county (e.g. MSA, city, ZIP code, etc.)
  4) Add degree information/find degree deserts using IPEDS data (@davidlangwgu is adding this, see his branch)
  5) Use alternative occupational coding schemes.
